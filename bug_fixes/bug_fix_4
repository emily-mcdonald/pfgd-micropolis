Summary: Fire stations turn into police stations
Description: Found the bug in MapScanner.java in the function doFireStation. When the game repairs the fire station, it repairs it as a police station. Changed POLICESTATION to FIRESTATION in repairZone

void doFireStation()
	{
		boolean powerOn = checkZonePower();
		city.fireStationCount++;
		if ((city.cityTime % 8) == 0) {
			repairZone(FIRESTATION, 3);
		}
